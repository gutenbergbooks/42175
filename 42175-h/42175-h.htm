<h2>THE WINTER SOLSTICE ALTARS AT HANO<br />
    PUEBLO</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By J. WALTER FEWKES</span></h3>
<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></a></h3>
<p>The fetishes displayed in their kivas by different phratries
    during the Winter Solstice ceremony at the Hopi pueblo of
    Walpi, in northeastern Arizona, have been described in a previous
    article,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in which the altar made in the <i>Moñkiva</i>, or &quot;chief&quot; ceremonial
    chamber, by the <i>Patki</i> and related people has been given
    special attention. The author had hoped in 1898<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to supplement
    this description by an exhaustive study of the Winter Solstice
    ceremonies of all the families of the East Mesa, but was prevented
    from so doing by the breaking out of an epidemic. This study
    was begun with fair results, and before withdrawing from the
    kivas he was able to make a few observations on certain altars
    at Hano which had escaped him in the preceding year.</p>
<p>Walpi, commonly called by the natives <i>Hopiki</i>, &quot;Hopi
    pueblo,&quot; began its history as a settlement of Snake clans
    which had united with the Bear phratry. From time to time this
    settlement grew in size by the addition of the <i>Ala</i>, <i>Pakab</i>, <i>Patki</i>,
    and other phratries of lesser importance. Among important increments
    in modern times may be mentioned several clans of
    Tanoan ancestry, as the <i>Asa</i>, <i>Honani</i>, and the like. These have
    all been assimilated, having lost their identity as distinct peoples
    and become an integral part of the population of Walpi, or of its
    colony, Sitcomovi.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Among the most recent arrivals in Tusayan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> was another group of Tanoan clans which will be considered in
    this article. The last mentioned are now domiciled in a pueblo
    of their own called Hano; they have not yet, as the others, lost
    their language nor been merged into the Hopi people, but still
    preserve intact many of their ancient customs.</p>
<p>The present relations of Hano to Walpi are in some respects
    not unlike those which have existed in the past between incoming
    clans and Walpi as each new colony entered the Tusayan territory.
    Thus, after the <i>Patki</i> people settled at the pueblo called
    Pakatcomo,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> within sight of Old Walpi, they lived there for some
    time, observing their own rites and possibly speaking a different
    language much as the people of Hano do today. In the course of
    time, however, the population of the <i>Patki</i> pueblo was united
    with the preëpre Walpi families, Pakatcomo was abandoned,
    and its speech and ritual merged into those of Walpi. Could we
    have studied the <i>Patki</i> people when they lived at their former
    homes, Pakatcomo or Homolobi, we would be able to arrive
    at more exact ideas of their peculiar rites and altars than is now
    possible. Hano has never been absorbed by Walpi as the <i>Patki</i> pueblos were, and the altars herein described still preserve their
    true Tanoan characteristics. These altars are interesting because
    made in a Tanoan pueblo by Tewa clans which are intrusive in
    the Hopi country, and are especially instructive because it is held
    by their priests that like altars are or were made in midwinter
    rites by their kindred now dwelling along the Rio Grande in New
    Mexico.</p>
<p>The midwinter rite in which the altars are employed is called <i>Tûñtai</i> by the Tewa, who likewise designate it by the Hopi name <i>Soyaluña</i>. This latter term may be regarded as a general one
    applied to the assemblages of different families in all the kivas of
    the East Mesa at that time. The name of the Tewa rite is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> special one, and possibly the other families who assemble at this
    time once had or still retain their own names for their celebrations.
    The <i>Tûñtai</i> altars were brought by the ancestors of the
    present people of Hano from their old eastern home, and the rites
    about them are distinctly Tewan, although celebrated at the same
    time as the Winter Solstice ceremonies of the Hopi families.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Clan Composition of Hano</span></h3>
<p>The pueblo called Hano is one of three villages on the East
    Mesa of Tusayan and contained, according to the writer's census
    of 1893, a population of 163 persons. It was settled between the
    years 1700 and 1710 by people from Tcewadi, a pueblo situated
    near Peña Blanca on the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Although
    only six persons of pure Tanoan ancestry are now living at Hano,
    the inhabitants still speak the Tewa dialect and claim as kindred
    the peoples of San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Pojoaque,
    Nambe, and Tesuque.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The best traditionists declare that their
    ancestors were invited to leave their old home, Tcewadi, by the
    Snake chief of Walpi, who was then pueblo chief of that village.
    They claim that they made their long journey to give aid against
    the Ute Indians who were raiding the Hopi, and that they responded
    after four consecutive invitations. The Walpi Snake
    chief sent them an embassy bearing prayer-sticks as offerings, and
    although they had refused three invitations they accepted the
    fourth.</p>
<p>According to traditions the following clans have lived in Hano,
    but it is not stated that all went to the East Mesa together from
    Tcewadi: <i>Okuwuñ</i>, Rain-cloud; <i>Sa</i>, Tobacco; <i>Kolon</i>, Corn; <i>Tenyük</i>, Pine; <i>Katcina</i>, Katcina; <i>Nañ</i>, Sand; <i>Kopeeli</i>, Pink
    Shell; <i>Koyanwi</i>, Turquoise; <i>Kapolo</i>, Crane; <i>Tuñ</i>, Sun; <i>Ke</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> Bear; <i>Te</i>, Cottonwood; <i>Tayek</i> (?); <i>Pe</i>, Firewood; and <i>Tceta</i>,
    Bivalve shell.</p>
<p>The early chiefs whose names have been obtained are Mapibi
    of the <i>Nañ-towa</i>, Potañ of the <i>Ke-towa</i>, and Talekweñ and Kepo
    of the <i>Kolon-towa</i>. The present village chief is Anote of the <i>Sa-towa</i> or Tobacco clan.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p>Of the original clans which at some time have been with the
    Hano people, the following have now become extinct: <i>Kopeeli</i>, <i>Koyanwi</i>, <i>Kapolo</i>, <i>Tuñ</i>, <i>Tayek</i>, <i>Pe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and <i>Tceta</i>. The last member
    of the <i>Tuñ</i> or Sun people was old chief Kalacai who died about
    four years ago. It is quite probable that several of these extinct
    clans did not start from Tcewadi with the others. There were
    several waves of Tanoan emigrants from the Rio Grande region
    which went to Tusayan about the same time, among which may
    be mentioned the <i>Asa</i>, which took a more southerly route, via
    Zuñi. The route of the <i>Asa</i> people will be considered in another
    article, and the evidences that some of the <i>Asa</i> clans joined their
    kindred on their advent into Tusayan will be developed later.
    Probably certain members of the <i>Katcina</i> clan accompanied the <i>Asa</i> people as far as the Awatobi mesa and then affiliated with
    the early Hano clans.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The above enumeration of Hano population does not include
    Walpi and Sitcomovi men married to Hano women (23), nor
    Tewa men living in the neighboring pueblos (15).<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Adding
    these, the population is increased to 174, which may be called
    the actual enumeration at the close of 1898. Subsequent mortality
    due to smallpox and whooping-cough will reduce the
    number below 160.</p>
<p>In the following lists there are arranged, under their respective
    clans, the names of all the known inhabitants of Hano.
    There have been several deaths since the lists were made (December
    1, 1898), and several births which also are not included.
    It will be noted that the majority have Tanoan names, but there
    are several with names of Hopi origin, for in these latter instances
    I was unable to obtain any other.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The present families in Hano are so distributed that the oldest
    part of the pueblo is situated at the head of the trail east of the <i>Moñkiva</i>.  This is still owned and inhabited by the <i>Sa</i>, <i>Kolon</i>, and <i>Ke</i> clans, all of which probably came from Tcewadi.  The <i>Katcina</i> and related <i>Tenyük</i>, as well as the <i>Okuwuñ</i> and related <i>Nañ</i> clans,
    are said, by some traditions, to have joined the Tewa colonists after
    they reached the Hopi mesas, and the position of their houses in
    respect to the main house-cluster favors that theory.  Other
    traditions say that the first pueblo chief of the Tewa was chief
    of the <i>Nañ-towa</i>.  Too much faith should not be put in this
    statement, notwithstanding the chief of the <i>Tewakiva</i> belongs
    to the <i>Nañ-towa</i>.  It seems more probable that the <i>Ke</i> or Bear
    clan was the leading one in early times, and that its chief was
    also <i>kimoñwi</i> or governor of the first settlement at the foot of
    the mesa.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Tewa Legends</span></h3>
<p>According to one authority (Kalakwai) the route of migration
    of the Hano clans from their ancient home, Tcewadi, led them
    first to Jemesi (Jemez), where they rested a year.  From Jemesi
    they went to Orpinpo or Pawikpa (&quot;Duck water&quot;).  Thence they
    proceeded to Kepo, or Bear spring, the present Fort Wingate,
    and from this place they continued to the site of Fort Defiance,
    thence to Wukopakabi or Pueblo Ganado.  Continuing their
    migration they entered Puñci, or Keam's canyon, and traversing
    its entire length, arrived at Isba, or Coyote spring, near the
    present trail of the East Mesa, where they built their pueblo.
    This settlement (Kohti) was along the foot-hills to the left of the
    spring, near a large yellow rock or cliff called Sikyaowatcomo
    (&quot;Yellow-rock mound&quot;).  There they lived for some time, as the
    debris and ground-plan of their building attest.  Their pueblo
    was a large one, and it was conveniently near a spring called
    Uñba, now filled up, and Isba, still used by the Hano people.</p>
<p>Shortly after their arrival Ute warriors made a new foray on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> the Hopi pueblos, and swarmed into the valley north of Wala,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> capturing many sheep which they drove to the hills north of the
    mesa.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Tewa attacked them at that place, and the Ute warriors
    killed all the sheep which they had captured, making a protecting
    rampart of their carcasses. On this account the place is now
    called Sikwitukwi (&quot;Meat pinnacle&quot;). The Tewa killed all but
    two of their opponents who were taken captives and sent home
    with the message that the Bears had come, and if any of their
    tribe ever returned as hostiles they would all be killed. From
    that time Ute invasions ceased.</p>
<p>According to another good authority in Tewa lore, the <i>Asa</i> people left &quot;Kaëkibi,&quot; near Abiquiu, in northern New Mexico,
    about the time the other Tewa left Tcewadi They traveled
    together rapidly for some time, but separated at Laguna, the <i>Asa</i> taking the southern route, via Zuñi. The Tewa clans arrived
    first (?) at Tusayan and waited for the <i>Asa</i> in the sand-hills near
    Isba. Both groups, according to this authority, took part in the
    Ute fight at Sikwitukwi, and when they returned the village chief
    of Walpi gave the <i>Asa</i> people for their habitation that portion of
    the mesa top northeast of the <i>Tewakiva</i>, while the present site
    of Hano was assigned to the Tewa clans. During a famine the <i>Asa</i> moved to Tübka (Canyon Tsegi, or &quot;Chelly&quot;), where they
    planted the peach trees that are still to be seen. The ruined
    walls east of Hano are a remnant of the pueblo abandoned by
    them. The <i>Asa</i> intermarried with the Navaho and lost their
    language. When they returned to the East Mesa the Hopi
    assigned to them for their houses that part of Walpi at the head
    of the stairway trail on condition that they would defend it.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>In view of the tenacity with which the women of Hano have
    clung to their language, even when married to Hopi men, it seems
    strange that the <i>Asa</i> lost their native dialect during the short
    time they lived in Tsegi canyon; but the <i>Asa</i> men may have
    married Navaho women, and the Tanoan tongues become lost in
    that way, the <i>Asa</i> women being in the minority. There is such
    uniformity in all the legends that the <i>Asa</i> were Tanoan people,
    that we can hardly doubt their truth, whatever explanation may
    be given of how the <i>Asa</i> lost their former idiom.</p>
<p>In 1782 Morfi described Hano,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> under the name &quot;Tanos,&quot; as
    a pueblo of one hundred and ten families, with a central plaza
    and streets. He noted the difference of idiom between it and
    Walpi. If Morfi's census be correct, the pueblo has diminished
    in population since his time. Since 1782 Hano has probably
    never been deserted, although its population has several times
    been considerably reduced by epidemics.</p>
<p>In return for their aid in driving the Ute warriors from the
    country, the Hopi chief gave the Tewa all the land in the two
    valleys on each side of the mesa, north and east of a line drawn
    at right angles to <i>Wala</i>, the Gap. This line of demarcation is
    recognized by the Tewa, although some of them claim that the
    Hopi have land-holdings in their territory. The line of division
    is carefully observed in the building of new houses in the foot-hills,
    for the Hopi families build west of the line, the Tewa people
    east of it.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Differences in Social Customs</span></h3>
<p>A casual visitor to the East Mesa would not notice any difference
    between the people of Hano and those of Walpi, and in fact
    many Walpi men have married Tanoan women and live in their
    village. The difference of idiom, however, is immediately noticeable,
    and seems destined to persist. Almost every inhabitant of
    Hano speaks Hopi, but no Hopi speaks or understands Tewa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> While there are Tewa men from Hano in several of the Hopi
    villages, where they have families, no Tewa woman lives in Walpi.
    This is of course due to the fact that the matriarchal system
    exists, and that a girl on marrying lives with her mother or with
    her clan, while a newly married man goes to the home of his
    wife's clan to live.</p>
<p>There are differences in marriage and mortuary customs, in
    the way the women wear their hair,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and in other minor matters,
    but at present the great difference between the Hopi and the
    Tewa is in their religious ceremonials, which, next to language,
    are the most persistent features of their tribal life. Hano has a
    very limited ritual; it celebrates in August a peculiar rite known
    as <i>Sumykoli</i>, or the sun prayer-stick making, as well as the <i>Tûñtai</i> midwinter ceremony, the altars of which are described herein.
    There are also many <i>Katcina</i> dances which are not different from
    those performed at Walpi. One group of clown priests, called <i>Paiakyamû</i>, is characteristic of Hano. Compared with the elaborate
    ritual of the Hopi pueblo, that of Hano is poor; but Tewa
    men are members of most of the religious societies of Walpi, and
    some of the women take part in the basket dance (<i>Lalakoñti</i>) and <i>Mamzrauti</i>, in that village.</p>
<p>The following Tewa names for months are current at Hano:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>January, <i>Elo-p'o</i>, &quot;Wooden-cup moon&quot;; refers to the cups, made
        of wood, used by the <i>Tcukuwympkiyas</i> in a ceremonial game.</p>
    <p>February, <i>Káuton-p'o</i>, &quot;Singing moon.&quot;</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
    <p>March, <i>Yopobi-p'o</i>, &quot;Cactus-flower moon.&quot; The element <i>pobi</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which is so often used in proper names among the Tewa, means
        flower.</p>
    <p>April, <i>Púñka-p'o</i>, &quot;Windbreak moon.&quot;</p>
    <p>May, <i>Señko-p'o</i>, &quot;To-plant-secretly moon.&quot; This refers to the
        planting of sweet corn in nooks and crevices, where children may not
        see it, for the <i>Nimán-katcina</i>.</p>
    <p>June-October, nameless moons, or the same names as the five winter
        moons.</p>
    <p>November, <i>Céñi-p'o</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> &quot;Horn moon,&quot; possibly referring to the <i>Aaltû</i> of the New-Fire ceremony.</p>
    <p>December, <i>Tûñtai-p'o</i>, &quot;Winter-solstice moon.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="smcap">Contemporary Ceremonies</span></h3>
<p>The Winter Solstice ceremony is celebrated in Walpi, Sitcomovi,
    and Hano, by clans, all the men gathering in the kivas of
    their respective pueblos. The <i>Soyaluña</i> is thus a synchronous
    gathering of all the families who bring their fetishes to the places
    where they assemble. The kivas or rooms in which they meet,
    and the clans which assemble therein, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <h3><i>Walpi</i></h3>
    <p><span class="smcap">Moñkiva</span>: <i>Patki</i>, Water-house; <i>Tabo</i>, rabbit; <i>Kükütce</i>, Lizard; <i>Tuwa</i>, Sand; <i>Lenya</i>, Flute; <i>Piba</i>, Tobacco; and <i>Katcina</i>.</p>
    <p><span class="smcap">Wikwaliobikiva</span>: <i>Asa</i>.</p>
    <p><span class="smcap">Nacabkiva</span>: <i>Kokop</i>, Firewood; <i>Tcüa</i>, Snake.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The altars or fetishes in the five Walpi kivas are as follows:</p>
<p>The altar described in a former publication<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is the most elaborate
    of all the Winter Solstice fetishes at Walpi, and belongs to
    the <i>Patki</i> and related clans.</p>
<p>The <i>Asa</i> family in the <i>Wikwaliobikiva</i> had no altar, but the
    following fetishes: (1) An ancient mask resembling that of <i>Natacka</i> and called <i>tcakwaina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> attached to which is a wooden crook
    and a rattle; (2) an ancient bandoleer (<i>tozriki</i>); and (3) several
    stone images of animals. The shield which the <i>Asa</i> carried
    before the <i>Moñkiva</i> altar had a star painted upon it.</p>
<p>The <i>Kokop</i> and <i>Tcüa</i> families, in the <i>Nacabkiva</i>, had no altar,
    but on the floor of the kiva there was a stone image which
    was said to have come from the ancient pueblo of Sikyatki, a
    former village of the <i>Kokop</i> people.</p>
<p>There was no altar in the <i>Alkiva</i>, but the <i>Ala</i> (Horn) clan
    which met there had a stone image of Püükoñhoya, and on the
    shield which they used in the <i>Moñkiva</i> there was a picture of
    Alosaka.</p>
<p>The <i>Pakab</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> (Reed or Arrow) people had an altar in the <i>Tcivatokiva</i> where Pautiwa presided with the <i>típoni</i> or palladium
    of that family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>The writer was unable to examine the fetishes of the <i>Honani</i> and <i>Asa</i> clans, who met in the two Sitcomovi kivas.  It was reported
    that they have no altars in the <i>Soyaluña</i>, but a study
    of their fetishes will shed important light on the nature of the
    rites introduced into Tusayan by these clans.  Tcoshoniwa is
    chief in one of these kivas.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p>Pocine, chief of the <i>Tewakiva</i>, belongs to the <i>Nañ-towa</i>, or
    Sand clan, and is the elder son of Pocilipobi.  Puñsauwi, his
    uncle, is Pocilipobi's brother.  As the <i>kimoñwi</i> or village chief of
    the Tewa colonists, when they came into Tusayan, belonged to
    the Sand clan, we may suppose this altar to be hereditary in this
    family.</p>
<p>Anote, the chief of the <i>Moñkiva</i> of Hano, is the oldest man of
    the <i>Sa-towa</i> or Tobacco clan.  Satele, who assisted him in making
    the altar, is a member of the <i>Ke</i> or Bear clan.  Patuñtupi, who
    was present when the altar was made at Hano, belongs to the <i>Kolon</i> or Corn clan.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Winter Solstice Ceremony</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Tûñtai</i> or <i>Soyaluña</i> ceremony of the East Mesa in 1898
    extended from December 9th to the 19th inclusive, and the days
    were designated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">9th, <i>Tcotcoñyuñya</i> (<i>Tcotcoñya</i>), Smoke assembly.</span><br />
        10th, <i>Tceele tcalauûh</i>, Announcement.<br />
        11th, <i>Cüs-tala</i>, First day.<br />
        12th, <i>Lüc-tala</i>, Second day.<br />
        13th, <i>Paic-tala</i>, Third day.<br />
        14th, <i>Yuñya</i>, Assemblage.<br />
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>15th, <i>Sockahimû</i>.<br />
        16th, <i>Komoktotokya</i>.<br />
        17th, <i>Totokya</i>, <i>Totokpee</i>.<br />
        18th, <i>Pegumnove</i>.<br />
        19th, <i>Navotcine</i>.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The active secret ceremonies began on the 14th and extended
    to the 19th. <i>Yuñya</i> was the day on which the Walpi
    chiefs entered their kivas, and <i>Totokya</i> that on which the most
    important secret rites were performed.</p>
<p><i>Tcotcoñyuñya</i>, Smoke assembly. The time of the Soyaluña is
    fixed by Kwatcakwa, Sun-priest of the <i>Patki</i> clan, who determines
    the winter solstice by means of observations of sunset on
    the horizon, as elsewhere described. The Smoke assemblage at
    Walpi occurred after sunset on December 9th, in the house of
    Anwuci's wife, adjoining the <i>Moñkiva</i>, and was attended by
    Supela, Kwatcakwa, Sakwistiwa, Kwaa, and Anawita, all chiefs
    belonging to the <i>Patki</i> clan. The Smoke assemblage at Hano,
    preliminary to the <i>Tûñtai</i>, was also held after sunset on December
    9th, and was attended by the following chiefs: Anote (Tem[)e]), <i>Sa-towa</i>; Satele, <i>Ke-towa</i>; Pocine (Koye), <i>Nañ-towa</i>; Patuñtupi, <i>Kolon-towa</i>.</p>
<p>There was no formal notification of <i>Tûñtai</i> from the housetops
    of Hano on the following morning, the <i>Soyaluña</i> announcement
    from Walpi serving all three pueblos on the East Mesa.</p>
<p>The formal announcement was made by Kopeli at daybreak
    of December 10th. Hoñyi, the regular <i>tcakmoñwi</i>, or town-crier,
    was snowbound at Keam's Canyon, and consequently was unable
    to perform this function.</p>
<p>The Smoke assemblage and its formal announcement at daybreak
    on the following morning have been observed in the Snake
    dance, and in the Flute, New-fire, and <i>Soyaluña</i> ceremonies; it
    probably occurs also in the <i>Lalakoñti</i> and <i>Mamzrauti</i>. It takes
    place several days before the Assembly day, when the chief
    enters the kiva and sets his <i>natci</i> or standard on the kiva hatch
    to announce that he has begun the ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Kivas at Hano</span></h3>
<p>There are two kivas in Hano, one of which, called <i>Tewakiva</i>,
    is situated at the head of the trail to the pueblo. The other,
    called the <i>Moñkiva</i>, is built in the eastern part of the plaza, and,
    as its name implies, is the &quot;chief&quot; Hano kiva. Both these semi-subterranean
    rooms are rectangular<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in shape, and in structural
    details resemble the kivas of Walpi. Each has a hatchway entrance
    in the middle of the roof, and is entered by means of a
    ladder which rests on the floor near a central fireplace. Neither
    of the Hano kivas has a window, but each has a raised platform
    for spectators east of the fireplace.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Altar in the Moñkiva at Hano</span></h3>
<p>Anote,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the chief of the <i>Moñkiva</i>, constructed his altar (plate <span class="smcap">XVIII</span>) on the day above mentioned as <i>Paic-tala</i>. He anticipated
    the others in making it, and began operations, about 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, by
    carefully sweeping the floor. His fetishes and other altar paraphernalia
    were in a bag on the floor at the western end of his
    kiva, but there was no <i>típoni</i>, or chieftain's badge, even on the
    completed altar.</p>
<p>Shortly after Anote had finished sweeping the floor of the
    kiva, Satele entered, followed a few minutes later by Patuñtupi.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> These three men, with Kalakwai, who was weaving a blanket,
    were the only persons in the kiva while the altar was being made.
    Immediately after the other chiefs came in, Anote began the
    making of prayer-sticks. Four of these were made, each of characteristic
    Tewa form.</p>
<p>Each of these prayer-sticks was double the length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> middle finger, and was painted black with green pigment at the
    blunt end. On one of the two sticks which compose this prayer
    offering, there was cut a facet which was painted green with
    black dots representing eyes and mouth. The stick without the
    facet was called the male, and upon it a ferrule was incised.</p>
<p>The two sticks were bound together with two cotton strings
    in two places, but no packet of prayer-meal was appended as in
    Hopi prayer-sticks (<i>pahos</i>).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> A string with a terminal feather
    was attached to that which bound the two sticks together.
    Anote likewise made many feathered strings called <i>nakwakwocis</i>,
    and Satele fashioned two prayer-sticks; all of these were laid in a
    basket-tray on the floor.</p>
<p>After these prayer offerings had been completed, Anote
    placed on the floor a blanketful of moist clay which he further
    moistened and kneaded, fashioning a part of it into a cylinder
    about a foot and a half long, and two inches in diameter. This
    object was made blunt at one end and pointed at the other.
    The image represents <i>Avaiyo</i>, the Tewa name of <i>Palülükoñ</i>, the
    Great Serpent. He added to the blunt end, or head, a small
    clay horn,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and inserted a minute feather in the tip of the tail.
    He fashioned into a ball the clay that remained after making the
    effigy of the serpent, patting it into a spherical compact mass
    about the size of a baseball. This, called the <i>natci</i>, later served
    as the pedestal to hold two eagle-wing feathers, and was placed at
    the kiva hatch each day to inform the uninitiated that ceremonies
    were in progress.</p>
<p>Having finished the effigy of the Great Serpent and formed
    the clay cylinder to his liking, Anote made on the western side of
    the floor of the kiva a ridge of sand, a few inches high and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> two feet long, parallel with the western wall. While making this
    ridge he sat between it and the kiva wall. Having patted this
    sand ridge to the proper height, he removed from their wrapping
    of coarse cloth, four sticks, each about two feet long. These
    sticks, dingy with age, were tied in pairs, and were called <i>poñya-saka</i>,
    &quot;altar ladders.&quot; They were inserted in the ridge in pairs,
    one on each side, and between them was placed in the sand a
    row of eagle feathers. As these were being put in position by
    Satele, Anote sang in a low tone, the song continuing as the other
    parts of the altar were arranged.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Anote was frequently obliged
    to prompt his associate regarding the proper arrangement of the
    objects on the altar.</p>
<p>Satele next drew a line of prayer-meal before the ridge of
    sand, and from it, as a base line, made three deep semicircles representing
    rain-clouds. These were drawn as simple, elongated
    outlines, but immediately the chief sprinkled meal on the floor
    over the space enclosed by them. The curved edges of the three
    rain-cloud symbols were then rimmed with black sand or powdered
    coal. About twenty short, parallel lines, representing
    falling rain, were next drawn on the floor with cornmeal, and
    alternating with them the same number of black lines. Satele
    then placed upon the rain-cloud symbols, skeleton puma paws, two
    for each rain-cloud. At the apex of each symbolic cloud a stone
    fetish of a bear was deposited, and by the side of each an arrow-point
    or other stone object was laid.</p>
<p>The clay effigy of the Great Snake was next placed back of
    the rain-cloud symbols, with the head pointing southward. As
    this effigy lay on the floor, Anote made on it, with meal, representations
    of eyes and teeth, then drew two lines of meal about
    the neck for a necklace, and two other parallel lines about the
    tail. Black powder was then evenly sprinkled along the back of
    the effigy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>Both Anote and Satele procured a few ears of differently colored
    corn and shelled them upon the rain-cloud picture, sprinkling
    the grains evenly over the meal design, and adding a few to the
    back of the Great Snake. Squash and melon seeds were likewise
    distributed in the same way. The vase from which the stone
    effigies and other images were taken was then placed near the
    base of the middle rain-cloud picture, and a large quartz crystal
    was added on the left. A conch, which the author presented to
    the chief, was placed on the right of this vase. Anote then swept
    the floor north of the fireplace, and as he sang in a low tone Satele
    drew a straight line of meal from near the right pole of the ladder
    across the floor to the middle of the altar. He placed along this
    line, at intervals, four feathers, and near where it joined the altar
    he stretched a string, with an attached feather, called the <i>pütabi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He then sprinkled a line of pollen along this trail of meal.</p>
<p>Anote's medicine-bowl was set just in front of the middle rain-cloud
    figure; the clay pedestal with inserted upright feathers
    stood before the left, and a basket-tray with prayer-meal before
    the right rain-cloud figure.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Altar in the Tewakiva at Hano</span></h3>
<p>The altar (plate <span class="smcap">XIX</span>) in the <i>Tewakiva</i> was begun about 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the Assembly day, and was made by Pocine,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> assisted by his
    uncle, Puñsauwi, both members of the <i>Nañ-towa</i>, or Sand clan.</p>
<p>The preparations began with the manufacture of a clay effigy
    of the Great Snake similar to but larger than that made by Anote
    in the <i>Moñkiva</i>. The clay was moistened and kneaded on the
    floor, and then rolled into a cylinder about three feet long, blunt
    at one end and pointed at the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>Four clay balls were made at the same time. One of these
    later served as the base of a standard (<i>natci</i>) which was subsequently
    placed each morning on the kiva hatch to warn the uninitiated
    not to enter. The other three were placed back of the
    altar and supported the sticks called the altar-ladders, which will
    be considered later.</p>
<p>Pocine outlined with meal on the floor a square figure which
    he divided into two rectangular parts by a line parallel with the
    northern side. He used meal of two colors&mdash;white for one rectangle,
    and light brown or pinkish for the other. Having made
    the outlines of the rectangle with great care, he carelessly sprinkled
    the enclosed spaces with the meal, hardly covering the sand base
    upon which the figures were drawn. He then added four triangular
    figures in meal on the south or front side of the rectangular
    symbols. These images represented rain-clouds, and were alternately
    white and brown.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> To the tips of these triangular rain-cloud
    figures he appended zigzag continuations with lozenge-shaped
    tips representing the lightning of the four cardinal points. A
    stone spearpoint or arrowhead was laid on each lozenge-like tip
    of the zigzag lightning.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p>The two men, Pocine and Puñsauwi, next raised the snake
    effigy and bore it to a position back of the rectangular meal
    figures on the floor. They deposited it in such a way that its
    head pointed southward. Having set the snake effigy in the
    position which it was to retain throughout the ceremony, Pocine
    sprinkled a black powder along the back of the image, while his
    uncle inserted several kernels of corn in the blunt end to represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> sent the teeth of an upper jaw. Two kernels of corn were then
    stuck into the head to indicate eyes, and an imitation necklace,
    also of grains of corn, was made around the neck of the idol. A
    double encircling row of corn grains was inserted in the tail or
    pointed end of the effigy, and Pocine added a small feather at
    the tip.</p>
<p>After the effigy had been put in position and adorned in the
    manner described, both Pocine and his uncle again shelled ears
    of corn on the rectangles of meal,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to which were added squash,
    melon, and other seeds. These were regularly distributed, some
    being dropped along the back of the image.</p>
<p>A row of eagle feathers was now inserted along the back of
    the effigy, instead of in a ridge of sand as in the <i>Moñkiva</i> altar.
    There were twelve of these feathers, and they were placed at
    equal intervals from the neck to the tail of the effigy. Puñsauwi
    then placed the three balls of clay, previously mentioned, back
    of the image, and in each of these balls he inserted two sticks,
    called <i>pahos</i>, similar to those used on the altar of the <i>Moñkiva</i>.
    These are ancient objects, being reputed to have descended from
    a remote past. One stick in each pair was called the male, the
    other the female, as is true of all double prayer-sticks used by
    the Hopi Indians. They are called <i>poñya-saka</i>, &quot;altar-ladders,&quot;
    and imitations<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of them in miniature are made and placed in
    shrines on the final day of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The insertion of the row of eagle-feathers along the back of
    the clay effigy of the serpent recalls an instructive reptilian
    figure on one of the bowls from Sikyatki.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In this ancient pictograph
    we find a row of triangles drawn along the medial line
    from the head to the tail of a lizard-like figure. The use of the
    triangle in ancient Pueblo pictography as a symbol of a wing-feather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> has been pointed out in an article on the feather
    as a decorative design in ancient Hopi pottery.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The medial
    line of triangles, representing feathers, on the Sikyatki food-bowl,
    is paralleled in the Hano kiva by eagle-wing feathers inserted
    along the middle of the image of a snake.</p>
<p>A small vase was next placed just in advance of the effigy of
    the Great Snake, and into this vase Pocine poured water from an
    earthenware canteen, making a pass as he did so to the four
    Pueblo cardinal points&mdash;north, west, south, and east&mdash;in sinistral
    ceremonial circuit.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> A stone arrow-point was then laid on the
    lozenge-shaped extremity of each lightning figure.</p>
<p>Pocine now scraped into the vase some powder from a soft
    white stone, saying, as he did so, that the process was called <i>sowiyauma</i>, &quot;rabbits emerge,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and that he wished he had stones
    of other colors, corresponding to the cardinal points, for the
    same purpose. After this was finished he emptied on the floor,
    from a cloth bag, a miscellaneous collection of botryoidal stones
    (many of which were waterworn), a few fetishes, and other objects,
    one of the most conspicuous among the latter being a large
    green stone. All were at first distributed on the meal picture
    without any special order, but later were given a definite arrangement.</p>
<p>Pocine next went up the kiva ladder, and standing on the
    upper rung in the sunlight, sought, by means of an angular piece
    of glass, to reflect a ray of sunlight on the altar, but more
    especially into the vase of medicine. Four turkey-feathers were
    then inserted at equal intervals along the base of the serpent
    effigy, as shown in plate <span class="smcap">XIX</span>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>After the stone objects had been arranged on the meal picture,
    a line of meal was drawn along the floor, from the right pole of
    the ladder to the altar. This line was drawn with great care,
    particular pains being taken to make it as straight as possible.
    There was no singing while this occurred, thus differing from
    the ceremony performed in the other Hano kiva. Four small
    feathers were placed at intervals along the line of meal. These,
    in sequence, beginning with the one nearest the ladder, were <i>sikyatci</i>, yellow-bird; <i>kwahu</i>, eagle or hawk; <i>koyoña</i>, turkey; and <i>pociwû</i>. Pocine sprinkled pollen along this line or meal trail.</p>
<p>There was then emptied from a canvas bag upon the rectangular
    meal figures a heterogeneous collection of objects, among
    which may be mentioned a bundle of gaming reeds, the humerus
    of a turkey, a whistle made of a turkey bone, and a zigzag
    wooden framework such as is used by the Hopi to represent
    lightning.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p>Back of the altar, leaning against the wall of the kiva, was set
    upright a wooden slat, notched on both edges and called <i>tawa-saka</i>,
    &quot;sun-ladder.&quot; Miniature imitations (plate <span class="smcap">XX</span>) of this are
    made in this kiva on the last day of the <i>Tûñtai</i> and deposited in
    a shrine near Sikyaowatcomo, the site of the early settlement of
    the Tewa. The <i>poñya-saka</i> or <i>tawa-saka</i> mentioned has not before
    been seen in any Hopi ceremony, and it may be characteristic of
    Tewa altars. A notched prayer-stick, called the rain-cloud ladder,
    is placed in the same shrine at this time. This is characteristic
    of the Tewa of Tusayan, but is not found in the Hopi <i>pahos</i>,
    with which I am familiar.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The reason these prayer-sticks are termed &quot;ladders&quot; is because
    they have the form of an ancient type of ladder made by
    notching a log of wood. They are symbols of the ladders by
    which the Sun is supposed to emerge from his house at sunrise.
    In the Hopi and Tewa conception the Sun is weary as he withdraws
    to the south in winter and these ladders are made to aid
    him in rising, and thus in returning to bless them. More light
    will doubtless be shed on the significance of the sun-ladder prayer-offerings
    when we know more of the ceremonies about the <i>Tûñtai</i> altars.</p>
<p>No <i>típoni</i> or badge of office was placed on this altar on the day
    it was made, and my abrupt departure from the East Mesa made
    it impossible for me to see the rites which are later performed
    about it.</p>
<p>It is evident, from the preceding description, that the priests
    of Hano have a knowledge of the Great Serpent cult corresponding
    to the worship of Palülükoñ. Among the Hopi the <i>Patki</i> people claim to have introduced this cult<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in comparatively
    recent times. There is a Tewa clan called <i>Okuwuñ</i> (Cloud)
    which corresponds, so far as meaning goes, with the <i>Patki</i> clan of
    the Hopi. Whether this clan brought with it a knowledge of the
    Great Snake is not clear, as traditions are silent on that point.</p>
<p>There is a tradition in the <i>Okuwuñ</i> clan that their ancestors,
    like those of the <i>Patki</i>, came from the south, and that the <i>Nañ-towa</i> bears a like relationship to the <i>Okuwuñ</i> that the Hopi <i>Tuwa</i> clan does to the <i>Patki</i>.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> If this tradition is well founded, a knowledge
    of the Great Snake fetish of the two Hano kivas may have
    been brought by the <i>Okuwuñ</i> and <i>Nañ-towa</i> into Tusayan from
    the same place as that of Palülükoñ.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>The Kwakwantu society of the <i>Patki</i> clans among the Hopi
    are intimately connected with this Great Plumed or Horned Snake
    cult. In some parts of the New-fire ceremony, in which this
    society takes a prominent part, each member of the society carries
    in his hand a small wooden image of a horned snake. These
    images are called <i>moñkohus</i>, some of the typical forms of which
    are figured in an article on the <i>Naacnaiya</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The head of the
    snake and its horn are well represented in several of these wooden
    effigies.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>
<p>The special interest attached to the Winter Solstice altars at
    Hano is in the fact that they are made by Tewa priests whose
    ancestors came to Tusayan about the beginning of the eighteenth
    century. The makers claim that their forefathers brought a
    knowledge of them from Tcewadi, in the upper valley of the Rio
    Grande in New Mexico, and that their relatives in the Tewa
    pueblos in the east still use like altars in their celebration at the <i>Tûñtai</i>.</p>
<p>Nothing, so far as known, has yet been published on the <i>Tûñtai</i> altars of the eastern Tanoan people, but ethnographers
    may yet find in the kivas of those villages material which will render
    the above descriptions of comparative interest. The resemblance
    of the <i>Tûñtai</i> altars to that of the <i>Patki</i> and related
    families in the Walpi <i>Moñkiva</i> at the Winter Solstice, is a very
    distant one. Both have snake effigies, but there is practically little
    else in common between them, or with the altar erected at the
    same time by the <i>Pakab</i> people in the <i>Tcivatokiva</i>. The <i>Tûñtai</i> altars
    are characteristically Tewan, and, while homologous with each
    other, are different from any yet known from the Hopi pueblos.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>The purport of the <i>Tûñtai</i> rites at Hano seems to be similar to
    that of the Hopi <i>Soyaluña</i>, namely, to draw back the sun in its
    southern declination, and to fertilize the corn and other seeds and
    increase all worldly possessions. As at Walpi, strings with
    attached feathers are made and given to men and women with
    wishes that the gods may bring them blessings. These strings
    are also attached to beams of houses, placed in springs of water,
    tied to the tails of horses, burros, sheep, dogs, chickens, and
    indeed every possession which the Indian has and wishes to
    increase. The presence of the idol of the snake means snake
    worship.</p>
<p>The survival of the Tanoan <i>Tûñtai</i> altars at Hano is typical of
    the way in which the Tusayan ritual has grown to its present
    complicated form. They are instances of an intrusive element
    which has not yet been amalgamated, as the knowledge of them
    is still limited to unassimilated people and clans.</p>
<p>Similar conditions have existed from time to time during the
    history of the Hopi, when new clans were added to those already
    existing. For many years incoming clans maintained a strict
    taboo, and each family held the secrets of its own religion; but
    as time went on and assimilation resulted by intermarriage,
    the religious society arose, composed of men and women of different
    clans. The family to which a majority of the membership
    belonged continued to hold the chieftaincy, and owned the altar
    and its paraphernalia, cherishing the legends of the society.
    But when men of other clans were admitted to membership, a
    mutual reaction of one society on another naturally resulted.
    This tended to modifications which have obscured the original
    character of distinctive family worship.</p>
<p>The problem of the Hopi ritual, by which is meant the sum of
    all great ceremonies in the Hopi calendar, deals largely with a
    composite system. It implies, as elsewhere pointed out, an investigation
    of the characteristic religious observances of several
    large families which formerly lived apart in different pueblos. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> necessitates a knowledge of the social composition of Walpi and
    of the history of the different phratries which make up the population
    of the village.</p>
<p>There is a corollary to the above conclusions. No pueblo in
    the southwest, outside of Tusayan, has the same ceremonial calendar
    as Walpi, because the population of none is made up of the
    same clans united in the same relative proportions. Hence the
    old remark that what is true of one pueblo is true of all, does not
    apply to their ritual. Some ceremonies at Jemez, Acoma, Sia,
    and Zuñi, for instance, are like some ceremonies at Walpi; but
    the old ceremonial calendar in any one of these pueblos was
    different from that of the other, because the component families
    were not the same. In the same way the ceremonies at Hano
    and Walpi have certain things in common, due no doubt to the
    assimilation in the latter of certain Tanoan clans, but their calendars
    are very different. The <i>Tûñtai</i> at Hano differs more widely
    from the Winter Solstice ceremony at Walpi, a gunshot away,
    than the Walpi observance differs from that at Oraibi, twenty
    miles distant. So we might also predict that if we knew the
    character of Winter Solstice altars in the Rio Grande Tewa
    villages, they would be found to resemble those of Hano more
    closely than the altars of Hano resemble those of Walpi.</p>

        of making their coiffures. Unmarried girls of Walpi and Hano dress their hair in the
        same manner, with whorls above the ears. Married women have different ways of
        wearing their hair in the two pueblos. During the wedding ceremonies at Hano the
        mother of the bride, in the presence of guests, combs her daughter's hair, or that part
        of it on the front of the scalp, over the face, so that it hangs down like a veil. She
        ties the hair on the back of the head in two coils, one of which hangs on either side,
        but the hair before the face she cuts on a level with the chin, beginning at the top of
        the ears. The hair which remains is too short to be done up in coils, and is simply
        brushed to one side or the other. Among Hopi married women all the hair is included
        in the two coils, and the &quot;bang&quot; is absent.</p>

        a sobriquet to which he strongly objects.  He is one of the oldest men of Sitcomovi,
        belongs to the <i>Patki</i> clan, and was formerly the <i>kimoñwi</i> or governor of
        Sitcomovi.  Hani, of the <i>Piba</i> (Tobacco) clan, is political chief of Walpi; and Anote,
        also of the <i>Piba</i> clan, is chief of Hano.  All the pueblos have <i>kimoñwis</i> or governors,
        and the office dates from early times; but these pueblo chiefs have no authority over
        pueblos other than their own.</p>

        is associated with cardinal points as in the Walpi Antelope altar. The lightning of
        the north is male, that of the west female, the south male, and the east female. The
        same holds with many objects in Hopi altars; thus the stone objects, <i>tcamahia</i>, of the
        Antelope altar follow this rule. In the same way plants and herbs have sex (not in
        the Linnean meaning), and are likewise associated with the cardinal points.</p>
